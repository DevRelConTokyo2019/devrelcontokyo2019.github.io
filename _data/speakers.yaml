    I’m a Developer Advocate and Developer Experience designer at Box. I like to
    look at great developer onboarding flows, analyzing and documenting the best
    practices and pitfalls of common design practices. Although I have over 15
    years of development experience I believe that at the core we’re all
    beginners at some things, and documentation and onboarding should reflect
    that notion.


    In the past I’ve worked as a contractor, startup founder, event organizer,
    and developer advocate at Braintree/PayPal.
