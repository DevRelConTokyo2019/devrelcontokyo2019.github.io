    title: The Art of Talk Design
    title_ja: トークデザインの世界
    description_en: >-
      Everywhere you look, stories surround us, and everyone has something
      that’s worth sharing with others. As evangelists, we need to understand
      how to structure our talks so they can have the best effect on the
      audiences we are trying to reach. How do you discover the right angle and
      the right story for a talk? How do you frame your story?


      Within tech we know how to approach building a new product: we research
      our user base, we figure out what and for who we’re trying to create
      something for and we make sure we constantly iterate on what we’ve come up
      with. So why aren’t we taking the same approach for our talks?


      This talk will examine how to get in the right mindset of examining your
      talk ideas, and will introduce a framework of how to design and iterate on
      your talk. It will focus on several exercises and questions to help you
      create the best talk for the story you’re trying to tell.
    description_ja: >-
      どこにいてもストーリーは存在し、そして誰もが他人と共有すべき価値がある何かを持っています。エバンジェリストとして、私たちはどのように話を構成すべきか理解しなければなりません。あなたはどのようにしてトークのための正しい方向性とストーリーを見つけ出しますか。ストーリーをどのように組み立てれば良いのでしょうか。


      開発において、私たちはユーザを研究し、何を誰のために提供するのか考えます。そして、そのフローを繰り返し続けるでしょう。なぜ私たちはトークに同じアプローチを取らないでしょうか。


      このセッションでは、トークのアイデアを検討する際の正しい方法にどのように取り組むかを検討し、どのようにしてトークをデザインして磨き上げるためのフレームワークを紹介します。それはあなたが伝えようとしているストーリーのために、あなたが最も良いトークを作るのを助けるために複数の演習と質問にフォーカスします。

    years of development experience I believe that at the core we’re all
    beginners at some things, and documentation and onboarding should reflect
    that notion.

      Have you ever sent a tweet or email that you regretted sending

      your private email was accidentally forwarded to someone it was not

      Online, things we say live on forever yet still we often post tweets, blog
      posts, emails without giving them a second thought. When one of these
      backfires on us is when we need the insights of the field of Public

      try to give you a set of basic questions that you can ask yourself to
      prevent you from making the most basic mistakes. Additionally, he will
      take you through the common practices in dealing with bad actors - those
      trying to have you make a mistake or say the wrong thing. At the end of

      It's not easy to have a DevRel team especially for companies which are not
      so big. But there're many things have to do. Then using external resources
      is required, and it's not easy as well. From my real experience, I'll
      share five tips on how to create a team to get a result!


      There might be many tips we can try, but for the first twelve months, how
      about trying only **FIVE** tips I always keep in mind. These are from my
      experiences and **SIMPLE** though the effectiveness is not small. My goal
      as a DevRel person is to acquire more users and create a user community of
      our IoT application development service, since I've started this role from
      March 2018. After nine months challenge, I could acquire hundreds of users
      and about 150 members of the community.


      I am still on the way of the journey, but I can show you real examples of
      my failures and success.

      Hackathons are the biggest thing at the moment, and it seems that everyone
      wants to hold one. Companies, startups, universities, and even governments
      all want to do a hackathon. But where do you begin? How do you get others
      to come and attend? And what is _even_ a mentor? This talk would go

    title: Why you need Ambassador Marketing for your DevRel business
    title_ja: DevRelにアンバサダーマーケティングが必要な理由
    description_en: >
      In this digital era, people output their opinions easily through internet,
      thus more and more companies are shifting towards ambassador marketing,
      the ultimate form of “word of mouth” marketing, which needs building good
      relationship between company and customer.


      I'll talk about these following things:


      1. What is a brand ambassador (corporate ambassador)?

      2. Traditional one-way marketing V.S. Ambassador marketing

      3. What is the deference between Influencer Marketing and Ambassador
      Marketing

      4. Why you need Ambassador Marketing for your DevRel business

      *
      昔はマス・マーケティングの時代と言われ、テレビや本を通して企業が『一方的に』大衆に情報を発信するのが一般的な時代でした。しかしデジタル時代と呼ばれる現代、企業と顧客の関係は、SNS
      やスマートフォンの普及により、がらりと変わりました。SNS
      を通して、顧客の声が可視化され、また拡散されるようになり、潜在的顧客はその『口コミ』を通して製品の購入や導入、店舗への来店を判断するようになっています。企業主体の情報発信の時代は終わり、顧客主体の情報発信の時代になった、ということです。

      * 「アンバサダー」とは、積極的に企業の製品の口コミを SNS やブログなどに投稿、アウトプットしてくれる『情報発信型 &&
      熱心なファン』のことを指します。例えば「松屋の新商品のハンバーグ定食めちゃ美味しいよ！」など写真付きツイートしてくれる人を指します。顧客主体の情報発信の現代は、この素晴らしいアンバサダーの方々をいかに確保し、維持するかが非常に大切になってきます。これは一般的な話だけではなく、Developer
      Relation の分野でも同じことが言えます。

      *
      私のセッションでは、このアンバサダーマーケティングと、よく聞くインフルエンサーマーケティングとの違い(全く違います)、そしてアンバサダーマーケティングをどう
      Developer Relation で生かすかについてお話いたします。

    title: Sustainable developer relations
    title_ja: 持続可能なDevRel
    description_en: >-
      We have a problem. Developer relations, as many people practice it today,
      is unsustainable.


      We shouldn't be flying half way around the globe each year or working
      every hour in the day. In this talk, I'll look at the four causes behind
      this:


      * The ongoing hunt for ROI: developer relation programmes are expensive
      and it’s tempting to feel you have to be everywhere at once to show just
      how hard you’re working.


      * Fear that the opportunity window will close: the investment will run out
      or the competition will win the market if you don’t speak at that
      conference 3,000 miles away on your dog’s birthday.


      * Peer pressure: we might not mean to, but we’ve created a culture where
      airport pictures and tweets about jet lag have normalised burn-out and
      also shown our non dev rel colleagues that this is what is expected.


      * Dev rel still isn’t well understood: mostly, though, it’s that there
      isn’t a common playbook for dev rel (maybe we need several) and so dev rel
      professionals don’t always know what to do and management/colleagues have
      outsized expectations of what dev rel can achieve.


      I'll then talk about how we can make a better developer relations plan
      that enables us to have a work-life balance, get great results for our
      employers, and build rewarding developer communities.

    description_en: >-
      In 2016 Stack Overflow’s Developer Survey had "poor documentation” as the
      2nd largest challenge at work, with only 0.2% less votes than "unrealistic
      expectations".


      So good documentation is a prerequisite for a great Developer Experience.
      But what documentation do you really need on your developer portal?


      In this talk I want to analyse some of the web’s best Developer Portals to
      answer that question.


      What are the jobs that we need a Developer Portal to fulfil? What are the
      best practices, and design patterns? How can these be implemented?


      Join me, to find out and to see how you could apply these patterns to
      improve your DX and your developer product's adoption.

      At previous DevRelCon events around the world, we've heard some fantastic
      talks about handling burnout, avoiding burnout, how to deal with burnout
      when it hits you (take. some. time. OFF.). This time, let's talk about
      something that _contributes_ to burnout, but that is constant in our
      industry and profession as much as any others - the changing landscape we
      work in.


      Technologies change. Your company's APIs _will_ change. The communities
      you work with may change.

      Your team may grow, shrink, be reorganized. In time, you may move into
      more senior leadership or management positions.


      Understanding that change is constant, and many of the dimensions where it
      may occur, can help us to navigate our paths ahead.

      This is a story of lessons learned across nearly 10 years in community
      leadership and developer relations.

    I am a software marketing executive with extensive experience in early-stage
    startups in Silicon Valley and Japan. I focus on building developer
    communities. Developer Relations is a key component to reaching customers
    and building awareness. I work with great companies like IBM, RICOH, and
    Renesas to leverage open source, open communities and open APIs to build
    strong developer communities that benefit community members and companies
    alike.


    DevRel doesn’t just happen, it requires planning, effort and insight. I have
    more than 15 years experience developing smart, high impact marketing and
    developer relations campaigns. I have been deeply involved in open source,
    networking, software development, enterprise software and high-performance
    computing (HPC).

    I act as the face of companies and communities and have a wide range of
    specialties around communications: marketing strategy, messaging and
    positioning development, competitive analysis, content development (writing
    and graphics), developer-focused tech PR, US market entry for non-US
    companies, Japanese language fluency.

    title: Why Japan Is Naturally Great at DevRel Internationally (US case study)
    title_ja: Why Japan Is Naturally Great at DevRel Internationally (US case study)
    description_en: >-
      RICOH THETA, the world's best selling VR camera, has a vibrant and large
      developer ecosystem in the US with thousands of registered developers
      opening up new markets in real estate, architecture, construction, law
      enforcement, used car sales and more.


      How did a seemingly conservative Japanese hardware maker get this far?


      Looking closely at the case study of RICOH THETA, I will show how Japanese
      companies can excel in DevRel. Japanese companies are famous for the
      Galapagos Syndrome where they are too focused on the domestic market and
      build products best suited for Japan only. However, Japan has natural
      advantages when trying to build developer communities in the US (and
      probably worldwide, though that is not covered in this case study).


      Oppkey worked closely with RICOH THETA over the past three years building
      a developer community that has helped RICOH identify new markets for the
      camera and radically extended the flexibility of the camera itself. RICOH
      started with excellent hardware but then went on to leverage their
      commitment to long term planning that helped them try techniques in 1-to-1
      and 1-to-many outreach and measure growth over several quarters instead of
      several months. They also relied on a culture of longer term partnerships,
      that allows for sharing of early information and extended support, once a
      good relationship is established. And they made a strong bet on local US
      talent - my company, Oppkey - in order to connect more closely with US
      developers.


      The case of RICOH THETA shows how Japanese companies have strong natural
      advantages for leveraging DevRel to succeed in the US - and worldwide.

    Nauman Ali is an API enthusiast who dived into the API world early into his
    career. Ever since his days at college, he was deeply interested in how
    systems interact and how the interactions between them can be optimized to
    produce better connections between digital entities. Working on a similar
    project he realized how hard it gets for developers to work with unfamiliar
    systems when working on these integrations and this opened him up to the
    world of Developer Experience and making APIs easy to consume. Since then he
    took off his journey with APIMatic, a New Zealand based startup set out to
    do the same. Nauman currently is leading the Developer Experience Portal and
    the CodeGen project at APIMatic and in his quest has met API Evangelists
    from around the world and has spoken at a number of conferences. He has
    developed a considerable insight into problems faced by both API Developers
    and consumer and can feel their pain and is set out on a mission to make
    life easy for both of them. In his free time, he loves watching football and
    is currently really sad about Ronaldo leaving his favorite club, Real
    Madrid.

      # An API Spec driven Developer Experience journey


      ----


      Developer Experience has taken center stage for a lot of API providers,
      with others following suit. In spite of it being an important part of the
      API lifecycle, it has been a tough nut to crack for a lot of API
      providers. The effort, time and cost required to achieve top-notch
      Developer Experience tend to be a big obstacle, while the various
      components getting out of sync just adds to the woes.

      With the wide adoption of the API Specification as the single source of
      truth and the center stage of most API endeavors, it is only fitting for
      it to be the engine behind fixing the Developer Experience woes of API
      providers.

      I will walk you through the journey of achieving top-notch Developer
      Experience by maximizing the use of the API Specifications. First, I will
      talk about the components that make a Developer Experience great. I'll
      then walk through the improvements and additions that can be made to API
      Specifications that leads to great Developer Experience components.
      Following that, I’ll dive into using the specification to generate Guides,
      Documentation, SDKs and Code samples, and will compare the different
      tooling out there that can help you achieve that. Finally, I'll highlight
      the advantages of automatic generation of these components over manually
      creating them and will present an internal case study on how we've used
      that at APIMatic.

    title: Effective real-time mashup performance for DevRel!
    title_ja: DevRelのための効果的なリアルタイムマッシュアップパフォーマンス！
    description_en: >-
      ## What is "real-time mashup performance" ?


      Attraction of products to tell at DevRel. Its function is not only inside.
      The outside is also important. In other words, connecting with other
      technologies will also create a form of charm. It is important in the
      place of IoT and Cloud where I participate.


      ### Mashup


      I present possibilities to understand the product and connect with other
      technologies. That's "mashup"!


      For example,


      * IoT device to connect various data of WEB. Make you feel familiar use
      case with data and devices.

      * Collaborate the cloud with new hardware. Make you feel exploring to new
      uses.

      * Combine technologies a little away such as AI. Make you feel the future.


      ## Realtime


      However, only the mashup concept is weak. So add. I demonstrate it in
      front of your eyes.


      real time! Then a strong message is born!


      I will show the actual case on the day. Tips are also included to
      communicate the secret of success.


      ## Benefits


      "Mash up real time performance" It is very difficult. However, its success
      is great.


      Developers feel,


      * "It's really moving! Follow the idea!"

      * "I also want to try it!"

      * "Feel the possibility of this product!"


      Such a strong message is transmitted. We can evoke the interest of
      developers!


      Tell this kind of benefits on the day! Based on a case study.

      You can’t throw a party if the front door is blocked. More than 60% of
      users sign up for a service, bounce during onboarding, and never return.
      If your company depends on developers, then how they get started, use, and
      contribute to your communities, libraries, tools, and APIs should be more
      than just painless. Your onboarding design should be elegant.


      In this Talk, you will learn:

      - Best practices in designing a stellar first user experience

      - Tools, content, and tactics to maintain user momentum

      - How GitHub solved their own problems using this strategy with GitHub
      Apps.
